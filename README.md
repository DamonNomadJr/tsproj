#### Apprism TS/JS Training Project

A single page application which ables the user to add simple cards, having a title, description and tags.
The card can be added using an interactive interface. Tags are simply unique user-defined words. Both cards and tags are removable.
Once a card has been added, the title and description cannot be changed. However, tags can still be added or removed to each published card.
The app should have a line on top of the page which shows the title of the latest added card. This line would be bound and synced with the title of a card which is being created.

# Notes

> To guide the user, tags should be added via a select input and the list should ALWAYS be the most updated one.
> Removing a tag from the tag list, should also remove it from all cards having it.
